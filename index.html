            <p>Probably you've never heard of me. And I don't blame you. I've tried to make a name in the tech industry for three years, but I failed. This game has rules that I didn't follow, making me responsible for my decisions. Now, this time will be different. Rather than selling my soul, I will follow my heart and work for my dreams, not others.</p>
            <p>I'm tired of trying to please corporations. I want to avoid getting molded by companies and market trends to remove the joy from the only thing fulfilling me: solving problems. I'll use my art and engineering to create the foundations of my life's workâ€”the lights of my trail.</p>
            <p>For the following months, you'll see me shining and working hard to support and collaborate with developers worldwide, bringing alive solutions for everyone. I'll become the software developer that this world needs. I'll prove to you, all of you, that I was born for it.</p>
